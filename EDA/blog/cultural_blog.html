                <h2><a id="2014-12-04" href="#2014-12-04">My thinking style</a></h2>
                <p class="date">2014-12-04</p>

                <p>I took the EDA linked <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">test</a> on my <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Style</a> recently. Turns out I am relatively stronger in <em>Abstract-Sequential</em> and <em>Concrete-Random</em> style thinking and relatively weaker in <em>Concrete-Sequential</em> style thinking. I wasn't really sure what to think about that - those strong two are from opposite sides of the spectrum.</p>

                <p>However, there were some points that were emphasised in both of those styles. An <em>Abstract-Sequential</em> thinker, or <em>The Theorist</em>, seems to dislike repeatition of tasks due to the theories already having been explored and are no longer stimulating. While a <em>Concrete-Random</em> thinker dislikes re-doing things as practical experimentation is no longer needed. Both these resonate with me.</p>

                <p>With EDA, both of these styles have the potential to be a time-sink. I've already been lost into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_development_philosophies">depths of Wikipedia</a> when I'm supposed to be focusing on a challenge (<em>Abstract-Sequential</em>), and I've been frequently diverted by experimenting through a list of similar methods or objects, when any one of them will do the job (<em>Concrete-Random</em>). While I enjoy both of these and am not likely to completely stop, due to the large amount of material that EDA presents I may have to pay careful attention to the amount of time I spend on experimentation and exploration.</p>

                <h2><a id="2014-11-15" href="#2014-11-15">The cultural blog and thoughts on EDA</a></h2>
                <p class="date">2014-11-15</p>

                <p>I've now reached the end of the first week of material for Dev Academy. This, I imagine, will be the first of many posts about what we are learning on the course. This is the 'cultural blog', so will focus less on the coding and more about the 'soft skills' that we learn.</p>

                <p>I'll be honest: I'm not much of a writer so I am guessing these posts will be fairly short. I'll try and keep them up, however.</p>

                <p>I'm quite enjoying EDA so far. I like how the learning seems to be prioritied over assessment. I also like how EDA seems to teach practical skills before we learn about the systems themselves. However, I do hope that we cover some material on theory eventually.</p>

                <p>I think my biggest challenge about this type of environment is wanting to dig deeper into particular subjects, at the expense of moving on to new material. It seems like digging deeper is something that EDA encourages, but it also seems like there is so much content that it is impossible to cover everything to the depth that I would like.</p>

                <p>That said, they do say that EDA is just the start of learning about this stuff, so I suppose there is still a lifetime ahead to learn.</p>
