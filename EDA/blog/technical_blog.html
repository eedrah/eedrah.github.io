                <p>I've now reached the end of the first week of material for Dev Academy. This, I imagine, will be the first of many posts about what we are learning on the course.</p>

                <p>I'll be honest: I'm not much of a writer so I am guessing these posts will be fairly short. I'll try and keep them up, however.</p>

                <p>For the uninitiated, this week's material was on 'git' - a system for version control. Version control is all about keeping track of different versions of files, especially when they are edited by multiple users. It enables users to track what others are doing, work on multiple versions, edit concurrently without fear of breaking something for yourself and someone else, and revert back to a past version if you need to (and back to the future again!).</p>

                <p>GitHub is in the same ecosystem as git. GitHub is a website and service that enables you to save your projects (called 'repositories') on their servers so that multiple users can access the same repositories without needing to directly connect their computers to each other. Alternatively, you can use it as a place to store your code as a backup to your computer.</p>

                <p>That's week 1 for now - we'll be back for week 2!</p>
