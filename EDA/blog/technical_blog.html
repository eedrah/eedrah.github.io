                <p>This week's material started us on basic HTML and CSS. I'd like to talk about a subject that I have been struggling with during this week: static, relative, absolute and fixed positioning. What are the differences between them?</p>

                <h3>Static</h3>
                <p>Static is the default for every element. This tells the browser to place it in the logical location in the browser window according to its 'display' and 'float' properties and its order in the html. Note that the 'top', 'left', 'bottom' and 'right' properties are ignored if the position is 'static'.</p>

                <h3>Relative</h3>
                <p>Think of 'relative' is very similar to 'static'. The browser places the element in the default location in the document. But after doing so (and affecting the locations of the surrounding elements) it then moves the element by the amount in the 'top', 'left', 'bottom' and 'right' properties. It is important to note that the space reserved for it in the flow of the document is kept (and looks like a hole the size of the element). In addition, there is not a space reserved for its new location - and so can appear above or below other elements. Appearing above static elements is the default, and there is a property called the 'z-order' which can be used to get it below other elements - but that's a different blog post!</p>
                <p>Relative elements also serve as a reference point to absolute elements that are its children. Speaking of which...</p>

                <h3>Absolute</h3>

                <h3>Fixed</h3>

                <h3>Inherit and Initial</h3>

                <h2>Hello tech world! - and git</h2>

                <p>I've now reached the end of the first week of material for Dev Academy. This, I imagine, will be the first of many posts about what we are learning on the course.</p>

                <p>I'll be honest: I'm not much of a writer so I am guessing these posts will be fairly short. I'll try and keep them up, however.</p>

                <p>For the uninitiated, this week's material was on 'git' - a system for version control. Version control is all about keeping track of different versions of files, especially when they are edited by multiple users. It enables users to track what others are doing, work on multiple versions, edit concurrently without fear of breaking something for yourself and someone else, and revert back to a past version if you need to (and back to the future again!).</p>

                <p>GitHub is in the same ecosystem as git. GitHub is a website and service that enables you to save your projects (called 'repositories') on their servers so that multiple users can access the same repositories without needing to directly connect their computers to each other. Alternatively, you can use it as a place to store your code as a backup to your computer.</p>

                <p>That's week 1 for now - we'll be back for week 2!</p>
