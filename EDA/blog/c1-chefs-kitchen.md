Hello world! - the cultural blog

2014-11-15

I've now reached the end of the first week of material for Dev Academy. This, I imagine, will be the first of many posts about what we are learning on the course. This is the 'cultural blog', so will focus less on the coding and more about the 'soft skills' that we learn.

I'll be honest: I'm not much of a writer so I am guessing these posts will be fairly short. I'll try and keep them up, however.

That's week 1 for now - we'll be back for week 2!

Eedrah.
